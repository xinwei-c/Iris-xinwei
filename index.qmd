#### Hi, welcome to my site! My name is Iris (Xinwei) Chen. 



## About Me
<p class="hero-line">
   <span id="typing"></span>
</p>


I’m a senior student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying Journalism and Data Science. I am also a part-time volunteer with the Computational Approaches and Message Effects Research (CAMER) group in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
Besides, I study to grow into a marketing analyst and data storyteller who can turn numbers into something people actually understand.
By bringing together strategic communication and data science, I want to keep exploring how insight and technology can work hand in hand to make ideas real.
