    "text": "Main visualization\n\n\n\nIntroduction Text\n\nResearch Question:To what extent do counties influence changes in grocery store accessibility from 2010 to 2015?\nKey findings Food accessibility varies across countries and disproportionately affects certain communities. Limited access to grocery stores can contribute to food insecurity and broader public health concerns, especially in lower-income or rural areas. Using data from the USDA Food Environment Atlas, this study explores changes in food access across Wisconsin counties between 2010 and 2015. We examine how factors like county population size, urban vs. rural classification, and racial demographics relate to low grocery access. For clarity and consistency in interpreting the data, the following definitions were used: “Low access” refers to individuals living more than 1 mile from a grocery store in urban areas or more than 10 miles in rural areas. Additionally, all demographic variables were calculated as percentages within each group at the county level. For example, the percentage of white residents with low access was calculated by dividing the number of white individuals with low access by the total number of white residents in that county. This analysis focused specifically on counties within Wisconsin, using data from the USDA Food Environment Atlas.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto with my team\n\n\n\nTogether with my teammates Salma Gadelhak, Hanvin Moon and Chloe Siegel, we showed how grocery store access in Wisconsin counties changed between 2010 and 2015. Using R and Tableau, we visualized these disparities and uncovered patterns that often go unnoticed."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nObjectives\nThe visualization aims to explore how nutritional values differ across countries and ingredient types, and how the number of recipes published online has changed over time. This app targets general audiences like cooks and foodies curious about recipes data. Therefore, with the specific countries and ingredients selected, audiences can explore what is most relevant to them. The app prioritizes intuitive exploration so audiences can play around the functions.\nThe app uses controls for personalized exploration. With the first single ingredient dropdown, users can select the ingredient they are most interested in. The country selector, however, allows multiple choices so that audiences can filter a set of certain countries. Variable selectors for the scatter plot make the same display serve multiple analytical purposes. Thus, users can switch to various relationships without changing plots. Brushing works across the scatter and histogram, so one action reflects on several spaces. The year bar chart updates automatically with the filters, showing whether a pattern belongs to older or newer uploaded recipes.\n\n\nData Processing\nBefore visualization, I cleaned the datasets to remove rows with missing data and ensure valid time. I created new columns to decide whether a recipe included key ingredients such as flour, milk, butter, chicken and beef. These ingredient indicators were used to allow filtering and comparison across different food types. Another important step was grouping the calorie variable into broad ranges (0-500, 500-1000, &gt;1000). The step is to create a classification that distinguishes recipes’ energy density. The publication date was converted into a date format to analyze recipe trends by year. In addition, each row of the processed dataset represents a single recipe, including its nutritional information (calories, fat, carbohydrates and protein), average user rating, country of origin, and total preparation time.\n\n\nKey Variables\n\ncalories, fat, carb, proteins: nutritional content per serving.\navg_ratings: average rating out of 5 stars, which can reflect user satisfaction\ntotal_time: total time needed to create the recipe\ncountry: Indicates the cuisine’s country of origin.\ndate_published: The date when the recipe was first uploaded online\nflour, milk, butter, chicken, beef, pork, fish: if the recipes contain certain ingredients\n\n\n\nDesign\nWith the contexts on the top, the interface basically applies a left sidebar and right layout to minimize hand and eye movement. Based on that, controls stay grouped together and outputs remain aligned vertically. Colors come from a clean palette. All three plots share identical heights and a uniform minimalist theme so the eye can move vertically. Margins between the top context area and the main display give breathing space.\n\n\nInsights\nWhen using the app, I found something unexpected by selecting and brushing through the data. For Argentinian recipes, the plot shows that dishes with more fat usually get lower ratings on the website. The average calories for these recipes are about 291 kcal. But when I select Thai food, the pattern looks different as the dishes with more fat actually get higher ratings, and the average calories rise to around 421 kcal. This kind of insight is easier to see with the multiple variables selection. Besides, as the app lets me filter by country and highlight parts of the plot, it becomes easy to notice that the same factor can be linked to ratings in different ways depending on the origin of the country."

The competition invites students to explore global challenges through creative, research driven, and socially engaged projects. It asks participants to demonstrate leadership through original work that reflects critical thinking, international awareness, and the ability to communicate complex social issues to diverse audiences.\nMy submission, which received an Excellent Prize, examines the gendered labor inequalities depicted by media that became especially visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although women formed the majority of frontline medical workers in mainland China, their contributions were underrepresented in mainstream media coverage. The project uses visual storytelling to highlight the discrepancy between women’s essential labor and the limited visibility granted to them in public narratives. The poster therefore functions as both a critique of media framing and a call to acknowledge the structural conditions that obscure women’s work despite their central role in public health and community care."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Main Site\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe project aims to making key functionality of the OpenAir package accessible to non-technical audiences through an interactive interface. This narrower scope addresses a specific gap by creating air quality visualizations that are easy to interpret, making this information accessible to community members and other stakeholders who might benefit from exploring local pollution patterns.\nFor this prototyping exercise, we built a Shiny App containing four interactive plots: a pollution map (for this exercise, we used Wisconsin), a polar plot, a seasonality plot, an influence plot, and a pollution rose. Across all graphs, we used three key interactions where users could select the pollutant of interest, the meteorological variable of influence, and a time period. Through this, users can explore relationships between emissions, weather conditions, and temporal trends.\n\n\n\nGo to the App!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe full interactive application is hosted on ShinyApps: Launch Wisconsin Air Quality App\n\n\n\n\nData Process\n\nWe got the data from API and remove all the missing values.\n\n\n\nVisualizations Descriptions\n\n\n\nWisconsin State Map\n\n\nWisconsin State Map: We chose this visualization to start because maps are familiar to general audiences and serve as an easy entry point into the spatial variation of pollution. Since OpenAir provides pollutant summaries but not ready-made geographic visualizations, this prototype bridges that gap by showing how pollutant concentrations vary across Wisconsin counties. Color and dot size communicate relative pollutant levels, and when paired with the time filter, viewers can begin to understand seasonal and annual patterns. Pollution Rose: These visualizations help users understand wind direction and pollution concentration. It is intuitive for audiences familiar with compass directions and provides a compact summary of atmospheric patterns. Users can quickly see which directions contribute the most pollution, and the customization of each particle supports easy comparison of different pollutants. This is a great starting point as users move into the polar plot (which adds the variable of wind speed) as the pollution rose is a bit more digestible for non-experts.\n\n\n\nSeasonality Plot\n\n\nSeasonality Plot: We included this seasonality plot to give audiences an immediate sense of how pollutants evolve across Wisconsin in 2023. Line charts are familiar to general viewers, and the continuous shape helps them recognize rhythmic environmental fluctuations that might not be obvious from maps or directional plots. By anchoring each month along a clean horizontal axis, the visualization makes it easy to compare periods of relative stability, such as late winter and early spring, against moments of sharp deviation. This design choice trains users to interpret air quality not as a static number but as a dynamic phenomenon shaped by seasonal cycles, extreme events, and shifting weather systems. As users move through the dashboard, this temporal context prepares them to connect monthly patterns with the spatial and directional insights they encounter in other visualizations, ultimately deepening their understanding of Wisconsin’s air quality.\n\n\n\nPolar Plot\n\n\nPolar Plot: Polar plots are a signature openair visualization that show how pollutant concentrations vary with wind speed and direction (building on the pollution rose). However, they are also visually complex, so our prototype aims to make interpretation more approachable by having a ‘how to read’ guide. One aspect polar plots highlight is directional dependence, for example, whether high concentrations of pollution tend to originate from the southwest. In addition, the ability to customize the meteorological variable can allow users to explore different weather-pollution conditions. Finally, the time filter reveals seasonal patterns in wind-driven pollution trends.\n\n\n\nPollution Rose\n\n\nPollution Rose: These visualizations help users understand wind direction and pollution concentration. It is intuitive for audiences familiar with compass directions and provides a compact summary of atmospheric patterns. Users can quickly see which directions contribute the most pollution, and the customization of each particle supports easy comparison of different pollutants. This is a great starting point as users move into the polar plot (which adds the variable of wind speed) as the pollution rose is a bit more digestible for non-experts.\n\n\n\nInfluence Plot\n\n\nInfluence Plot: Influence plots help identify which meteorological conditions most strongly affect pollutant levels. In openair, this type of analysis is highly useful as it can help viewers explore what meteorological variables are most impactful on air pollution movement. Users can also see associations between pollutant concentrations and variables such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The time period feature is especially useful here, allowing viewers an opportunity to identify seasons where certain variables matter more.\n\n\nGroup Member\nThis is a group project and the members are Xinwei (Iris) Chen, Emma Clift, and Jonathan Morris"
